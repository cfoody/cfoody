- I am a current Junior in college. I am a double major in Computer Science and Cyber Security Analyst with a minor in Math. I am just looking for opportunities to learn. I have the most experience in coding, but slowing getting more networking and security knowledge.
- I interned at Savannah River Nuclear Solutions over the 2023 summer, and am excited to be joining them again this summer! I am currently working on my Portfolio website which will be open-source, and a project with my classmates called CardPool Trade!
